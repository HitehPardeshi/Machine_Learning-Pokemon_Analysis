This repository contains a dataset analysis project focusing on Pokémon. The dataset used in this analysis includes information about various Pokémon species, their attributes, and other relevant details. The aim of this project is to explore and gain insights into the Pokémon world using data analysis techniques.


## Analysis
The analysis is performed using Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The main analysis tasks include:

1) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand the distribution and characteristics of Pokémon species.

2) Statistical analysis of Pokémon attributes such as base stats, types, and abilities.

3) Visualization of various aspects of the Pokémon world using plots and charts.

* Distribution of Pokemon types.
 
* Relationship between Pokemon stats such as HP, Attack, Defense, etc.

* Identification of the most common and rare Pokemon types.

* Visualization of legendary vs. non-legendary Pokemon.

* Analysis of the strongest and weakest Pokemon based on their stats.

* Exploration of any correlations between Pokemon attributes.


## Files Included
**pokemon_dataset.csv:** This file contains the raw data used for analysis. It includes information about various attributes of different Pokemon species.

**pokemon_analysis.ipynb:** This Jupyter Notebook file contains the Python code used for the analysis. It covers data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualization, and interpretation of the findings.
